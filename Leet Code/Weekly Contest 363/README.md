This repository contains solutions and problem statements for Weekly Contest 363 on LeetCode.

## Contest Details

- Contest Date: September 17, 2023
- Start Time: 8:00 AM GMT+5:30
- Duration: 1 hour and 20 minutes

## Problems

### 1. [Sum of Values at Indices With K Set Bits](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-363/problems/sum-of-values-at-indices-with-k-set-bits/)

#### Problem Description

Given two integers `n` and `k`, you are given an array `indices` of length `n` containing integers from `0` to `n - 1`. You need to find the sum of values at indices where the number of set bits (1's) in the binary representation of the index is equal to `k`.

### 2. [Happy Students](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-363/problems/happy-students/)

#### Problem Description

You are given an integer `n`, a list of integers `indices`, and a list of integers `happiness`. You need to find the maximum happiness you can get by arranging students at the given indices in a circle. Happiness is calculated by summing the happiness of adjacent students. You can rotate the circle to maximize the happiness.

### 3. [Maximum Number of Alloys](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-363/problems/maximum-number-of-alloys/)

#### Problem Description

You are given two integers, `alloyA` and `alloyB`, representing the number of atoms of two types of alloys. You need to find the maximum number of alloys you can create by combining `alloyA` and `alloyB` such that each alloy is a compound of both types.

### 4. [Maximum Element-Sum of a Complete Subset of Indices](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-363/problems/maximum-element-sum-of-a-complete-subset-of-indices/)

#### Problem Description

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, you need to find the maximum possible sum of elements you can get by choosing a non-empty subset of indices such that no two elements in the subset are adjacent (i.e., they are not next to each other in the original array).
