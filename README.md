# Competitive Programming (Basic Placement Guide)

Having been through many coding assessments and interviews, I‚Äôve noticed some key concepts and problems repeat themselves. Whether you‚Äôre preparing for university placements or coding interviews at MNCs and startups, this repo covers the most common topics you‚Äôll encounter. 

> Practice and consistency are Important. The more problems you solve, the better you get.

## Top 10 Must-Know Concepts for Interviews

1. **Recursion** : Breaking a problem into smaller sub-problems, solving them with a base condition.
2. **Sliding Window** : Efficiently solving subarray problems by maintaining a window (range).
3. **String Manipulation** : Common string operations like reverse, substring, anagram detection.
4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** : Layer-wise graph traversal, useful for shortest path or tree level problems.
5. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** : Deep exploration in graphs or trees, used for connected components and cycles.
6. **Dynamic Programming (DP)** : Optimizing recursive problems by caching results to avoid recomputation.
7. **Greedy Algorithms** : Solving problems by making the best local decision at each step.
8. **Two Pointer Technique** : Efficiently working with sorted arrays by using two index pointers.
9. **Backtracking** : Trying possible solutions recursively, and undoing steps if necessary (e.g. N-Queens problem).
10. **Binary Search** : Searching in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space.

## Interview-Focused Concepts

1. **Palindrome**  
   A string that reads the same forward and backward. Often asked in string-based problems.  
   Problem: [LeetCode Problem 5](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring) (longest palindromic substring).

2. **OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
   Classes and objects, used in Java, Python, and C++ interviews.  
   Key Concepts: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction.

3. **Java**  
   Basic Java concepts like constructors, exception handling, and multithreading.  
   Problem: **Singleton pattern** or a **Comparator**.

4. **JavaScript**  
   Things like **closures**, **callbacks**, and **event loop** are frequent in frontend or full-stack interviews.  

5. **SQL**  
   Database management-related questions using **SELECT**, **JOIN**, **GROUP BY** commands.  
   VVIMP Query: Find the second-highest salary in a table.  
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(salary) 
   FROM employees 
   WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
   ```

## Personal Note :)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> heyyy there.. Just a little something from me to you.. >>
> Be regular in your practice, that's the most important thing in our line of work. If I can do LeetCode medium problems today and then take a break from coding for 3-4 months, I won‚Äôt even be able to handle LeetCode easy problems later.
> So, whatever time you can spend on coding, make sure you spend it consistently. Participating in weekly contests on platforms like GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, CodeChef, or Codeforces will give you a **reality check** on your speed and efficiency.
